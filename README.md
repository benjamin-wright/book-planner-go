# Book Planner

A golang-based microservices app for planning novels and books. A test bed for trying:
- traefik forward auth
- custom operator-driven database and migration management
- golang-based microservices monorepo
- golang-based MVC using html/template lib to minimise javascript payload
- maybe: golang-based wasm front-end modules using tinygo and generators
- k3d and tilt-driven development environment

Prime directive is minimal resource footprint in terms of development overhead and runtime overhead

## ToDo

- remove static server redirect and add app chart default route bool
