A golang-based microservices app for planning novels and books. A test bed for trying:
- traefik forward auth
- custom operator-driven database and migration management
- golang-based microservices monorepo
- golang-based MVC using html/template lib to minimise javascript payload
- k3d and tilt-driven development environment
